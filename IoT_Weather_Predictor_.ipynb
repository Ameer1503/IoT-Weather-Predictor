        "# **IoT Temperature and Humidity Predictor using AutoTS Algorithm**\n",
        "AutoTS is an automated time series forecasting library in Python that uses a genetic algorithm to search for the best model parameters for a given dataset. It is built on top of the popular machine learning library scikit-learn and provides a simple, easy-to-use interface for training and evaluating time series models.\n",
        "\n",
        "AutoTS can handle various time series forecasting tasks, including univariate, multivariate, and forecasting with missing values. It also provides a range of models, including classical statistical models such as ARIMA and exponential smoothing, as well as machine learning models such as Random Forests and XGBoost.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the key benefits of AutoTS is its ability to automatically select the best model parameters without requiring manual tuning. This is accomplished by using a genetic algorithm to search for the best model parameters based on a given set of evaluation metrics. This makes it particularly useful for data scientists and analysts who may not have deep expertise in time series modeling but still need to generate accurate forecasts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, AutoTS is a powerful and flexible tool for time series forecasting that can help users save time and effort in selecting and training models."
